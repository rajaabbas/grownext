# @ma/config

Shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier presets consumed across the monorepo. Use
these configs to keep tooling consistent between apps and packages.

## Use it

```json
{
  "extends": "@ma/config/tsconfig.react.json"
}
```

See `docs/meta/contributing.md` for lint/typecheck expectations and
