# Meta Documentation

Process and workflow guidance lives here. These documents complement the
technical guides, helping contributors (human or automation) follow the
expected conventions.

## Index

- [`contributing.md`](contributing.md) – branching strategy, test/lint
  expectations, and review checklist.
- [`automation.md`](automation.md) – guardrails for automation, CI expectations,
  and release plan coordination.
- [`plans/`](plans/README.md) – release plans per app; update these before any
  version bump.

Add new meta docs (templates, onboarding notes, etc.) inside this folder and
reference them from the top-level docs index.
