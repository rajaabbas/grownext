# Tasks Launch Readiness – Tasks App Plan (v0.1.4)

> Status: 📝 Draft (Nov 2025). Part of `docs/meta/plans/epics/tasks-launch-epic-v0.1.4.md`.

## Goals
- Polish the Tasks product experience (UX, performance, resilience) for GA.
- Ensure tenant onboarding + lifecycle flows are intuitive and reliable.
- Integrate telemetry, analytics, and payments signals for ongoing monitoring.

## Scope
1. **Product Experience *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Close high-priority UX bugs, responsive issues, and accessibility gaps.
   - [ ] Add empty-state guidance + success messaging across core views.
   - [ ] Validate real-time updates (optimistic UI, websockets/polling) under load.
2. **Onboarding & Lifecycle *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Build tenant onboarding wizard with checklist + progress tracking.
   - [ ] Ensure entitlement/role enforcement across app sections.
   - [ ] Provide self-serve teardown/reset flow with audit logging.
3. **Telemetry & Analytics *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Emit activation + usage events to identity/billing ingestion.
   - [ ] Surface key metrics in portal dashboards (activation %, task completion).
   - [ ] Prepare GA release notes + in-app announcement content.

## Dependencies
- Updated identity scopes + APIs for Tasks operations.
- Worker queue stability + instrumentation.
- Portal entry points + billing usage alignment.

## Open Questions
- What adoption metrics constitute GA exit criteria?
- Are additional integrations (notifications, webhooks) required pre-launch?

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Component + integration tests covering core Tasks flows.
- [ ] Playwright regression suite updated for onboarding and high-volume paths.
- [ ] Performance profiling (TTI, API latency) meets agreed thresholds.
