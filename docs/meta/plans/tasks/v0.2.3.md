# Manual Validation ‚Äì Tasks (v0.2.3)

> Status: üìù Planned (Oct 2025). Provides manual QA coverage for Tasks prior to GA release.

## Goals
- Ensure notifications, collaboration surfaces, and user journeys behave correctly beyond automated checks.
- Capture known issues and mitigation guidance for launch-day support.

## Scope
1. **Manual QA & Collaboration Review**
   - [ ] Confirm worker-driven notifications (assignments, mentions) reach Tasks clients after token/impersonation updates.
   - [ ] Double-check collaboration surfaces (comments, mentions, real-time updates) for auth-related edge cases.
   - [ ] Capture follow-up issues to feed into the Oct‚ÄØ27 productivity/collaboration sprint backlog.
2. **Operational Readiness**
   - [ ] Perform a monitoring alert review (Grafana/PagerDuty) to confirm no auth-related error spikes post-deploy.
   - [ ] Document known issues/mitigations for the Oct‚ÄØ23 change window in release notes and support docs.

## Dependencies
- Latest staging build with guardrail changes.
- Worker notification queues functioning.

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Manual checklist signed off by product/ops leads with findings linked in Linear.

## Documentation
- [ ] Append manual QA findings to `docs/operations/runbooks/tasks.md` and release notes.
