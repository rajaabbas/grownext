# Tasks v0.1.1 Plan

## Goals
- Align task assignments with new admin bulk operations (activation/suspension).
- Surface background job insights for tenant managers.
- Strengthen telemetry around queue delays and API errors.

## Scope
1. **Account state awareness**
   - Respect identity status (`SUSPENDED`, `INVITED`) when showing task dashboards.
   - Notify tenant admins when bulk operations modify team memberships.
2. **Job visibility**
   - Add panel showing recent background jobs triggered from the admin console.
   - Link out to worker logs/Runbooks for remediation steps.
3. **Telemetry**
   - Emit structured metrics on task assignment latency and queue depth.
   - Capture Redis connection health and expose Grafana dashboard docs.

## Dependencies
- Identity bulk job events (see `docs/meta/plans/identity/v0.1.1.md`).
- Worker metrics publishing/telemetry feeds (`docs/meta/plans/worker/v0.1.1.md`).

## Testing
- Extend component tests for new banners and job listing.
- Add integration test verifying suspended users receive read-only view.

## Release Notes
- Increase version in `apps/tasks/package.json` to **0.1.1** post-completion.
- Update runbooks with new monitoring panels and alert thresholds.
