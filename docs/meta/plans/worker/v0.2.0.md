# Base Apps Hardening – Worker Plan (v0.2.0)

> Status: 📝 Draft (Oct 2025). Ensures worker processors align with the Oct 23 identity hardening updates.

## Goals
- Confirm worker queues continue to operate under stricter identity access controls and token expiry behavior.
- Improve observability and error handling for impersonation cleanup and notification jobs.
- Prepare the automation surface for the rest of the Oct 23–31 sprint sequence.

## Scope
1. **Queue Compatibility *(Status: 📝 Draft – Oct 2025)***
   - [ ] Validate billing, notification, and impersonation processors against identity’s updated token/guardrail logic.
   - [ ] Refresh service-role claim usage where identity-client headers or payloads changed.
   - [ ] Ensure retry/backoff strategies accommodate new throttling responses.
2. **Observability & Logging *(Status: 📝 Draft – Oct 2025)***
   - [ ] Add structured logs for impersonation cleanup and notification jobs to highlight guardrail-triggered failures.
   - [ ] Verify metrics emitted for billing/notification queues feed the consolidated Oct 30 validation dashboards.
   - [ ] Update alert thresholds as needed to reflect tightened throughput expectations.
3. **Docs & Automation *(Status: 📝 Draft – Oct 2025)***
   - [ ] Document smoke pipeline hooks for worker health checks aligned with identity deploys.
   - [ ] Capture any required tooling adjustments ahead of the Oct 30 performance rehearsal.
   - [ ] Sync CLI usage notes with support/runbook teams.

## Dependencies
- Identity v0.2.0 deployment and revised identity-client helpers.
- Portal/admin feedback on impersonation or billing telemetry surfaced via worker.
- Tasks app validation for notification delivery under new auth conditions.

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests covering queue handlers affected by identity guardrails.
- [ ] End-to-end smoke run verifying billing usage aggregation and impersonation cleanup.
- [ ] Monitoring review for queue lag/error metrics post-deploy.

## Documentation
- [ ] Update worker runbook with new logging/alerting details.
- [ ] Record release notes summarizing worker readiness for Oct 23.
