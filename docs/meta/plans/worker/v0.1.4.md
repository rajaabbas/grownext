# Tasks Launch Readiness – Worker Plan (v0.1.4)

> Status: 📝 Draft (Nov 2025). Linked to `docs/meta/plans/epics/tasks-launch-epic-v0.1.4.md`.

## Goals
- Ensure Tasks job processors meet latency/SLA targets under production load.
- Validate concurrency, retry, and dead-letter handling for long-running tasks.
- Provide operational tooling for backfills, diagnostics, and load testing.

## Scope
1. **Processor Hardening *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Benchmark task processors (ingest, execution, cleanup) with synthetic load.
   - [ ] Tune concurrency + scheduling to keep queues within SLA.
   - [ ] Add guardrails for runaway jobs (timeouts, resource caps).
2. **Telemetry & Alerting *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Ship dashboards tracking queue depth, failure rates, processing time.
   - [ ] Configure alerts for saturation + stuck jobs.
   - [ ] Publish weekly health report templating.
3. **Tooling & Scripts *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Extend CLI to seed demo Jobs/tenants for testing.
   - [ ] Align billing load-test harness with Tasks toggles + metrics capture.
   - [ ] Document backfill + replay procedures for Tasks data.

## Dependencies
- Identity auth tokens/scopes for worker control-plane calls.
- Portal/admin integration for surfacing worker state.
- Observability infrastructure for queue metrics.

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Vitest/unit coverage for scheduling helpers.
- [ ] End-to-end load test signed off (shared with identity/billing).
- [ ] Chaos/retry drill executed in staging with documented results.
