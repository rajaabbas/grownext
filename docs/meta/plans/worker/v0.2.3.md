# Manual Validation ‚Äì Worker (v0.2.3)

> Status: üìù Planned (Oct 2025). Outlines the manual soak tests and operational reviews required before GA.

## Goals
- Validate throttling/backoff behaviour and queue observability under real workloads.
- Ensure documentation and smoke hooks reflect latest identity guardrails.

## Scope
1. **Operational Soak & Monitoring**
   - [ ] Run targeted soak tests to ensure retry/backoff strategies accommodate new throttling responses; log findings.
   - [ ] Verify metrics emitted for billing/notification queues feed the consolidated validation dashboards (Grafana/Looker).
   - [ ] Execute the end-to-end smoke run for billing usage aggregation and impersonation cleanup; capture results.
   - [ ] Perform a monitoring review for queue lag/error metrics post-deploy and log any remediation tasks.
2. **Documentation Updates**
   - [ ] Document smoke pipeline hooks for worker health checks aligned with identity deploys (runbook + CI notes).

## Dependencies
- Identity/Portal teams on standby for telemetry confirmation.
- Access to staging Grafana dashboards and queue control tooling.

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Manual validation checklist signed off with soak-test artifacts stored in the ops drive.

## Documentation
- [ ] Update worker runbook/release notes with outcomes and follow-up actions from the manual pass.
