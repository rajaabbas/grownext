# Tasks Launch Readiness – Identity Plan (v0.1.4)

> Status: 📝 Draft (Nov 2025). Supports `docs/meta/plans/epics/tasks-launch-epic-v0.1.4.md`.

## Goals
- Harden Tasks-facing identity APIs (permissions, impersonation, audit trails).
- Ensure usage ingestion + billing hooks support Tasks workloads.
- Provide operational guardrails (dashboards, runbooks, throttling) ahead of launch.

## Scope
1. **Permissions & Tokens *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Finalize Tasks scopes/claims and document mapping to UI roles.
   - [ ] Extend impersonation + audit logging for Tasks actions.
   - [ ] Verify JWT/identity-client changes rolled out to dependent apps.
2. **Tasks API Hardening *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Stress-test Tasks routes (multi-tenant operations, pagination, filters).
   - [ ] Add rate limiting + circuit breakers where throughput risk exists.
   - [ ] Confirm idempotent job creation + webhook handling for Tasks events.
3. **Telemetry & Load Testing *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Execute joint Tasks + billing load test; capture identity metrics + traces.
   - [ ] Publish dashboards/alerts for Tasks API performance.
   - [ ] Update runbooks with remediation steps for common incident scenarios.

## Dependencies
- Worker service concurrency tuning + queue sizing.
- Portal/admin consumers updated to new identity-client build.
- Observability stack (logging + tracing) for Tasks endpoints.

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Vitest coverage for new Tasks scopes/helpers.
- [ ] Integration suites covering Tasks APIs with mocked worker/portal clients.
- [ ] Manual load test sign-off with archived metrics + notes.
