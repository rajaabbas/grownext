# Portal v0.1.1 Plan

> This plan rolls up under the operations & impersonation epic (`docs/meta/plans/epics/operations-epic-v0.1.1.md`).

## Goals
- Improve launch experience with richer tenant/product context.
- Provide proactive messaging around admin-led changes (bulk jobs, impersonation).
- Polish accessibility and performance on key pages.

## Scope
1. **Launchpad enhancements**
   - Display recent admin actions affecting the user (suspensions, entitlement updates).
   - Add quick links to tenant support docs and feature flags (if available).
2. **Notifications**
   - Consume new identity webhook for bulk job exports impacting the userâ€™s organization.
   - Show banner when the user is being impersonated by an admin.
3. **A11y & performance**
   - Audit component contrast and keyboard navigation for launcher cards.
   - Lazy load large product assets and measure LCP.

## Dependencies
- Requires identity webhook for admin actions (`docs/meta/plans/identity/v0.1.1.md`).
- Admin plan expects portal banner support for impersonation state.

## Testing
- Update Next.js route tests, include jest-axe checks for new UI.
- Add performance budget snapshot (Lighthouse) in CI.

## Release Notes
- Increment `apps/portal/package.json` to **0.1.1** after delivering the above scope.
- Note telemetry additions in `docs/overview/architecture.md` as appropriate.
