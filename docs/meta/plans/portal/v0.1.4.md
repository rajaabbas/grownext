# Tasks Launch Readiness – Portal Plan (v0.1.4)

> Status: 📝 Draft (Nov 2025). Aligns with `docs/meta/plans/epics/tasks-launch-epic-v0.1.4.md`.

## Goals
- Embed Tasks lifecycle surfaces in the customer portal (dashboards, onboarding, guidance).
- Ensure permissions + navigation respect Tasks feature flags and entitlements.
- Publish launch-ready docs and in-app messaging for Tasks rollout.

## Scope
1. **Tasks Home & Navigation *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Add Tasks entry points to portal nav + home dashboard (behind `PORTAL_TASKS_ENABLED`).
   - [ ] Deliver Tasks overview page (recent activity, queue health, quick actions).
   - [ ] Update Launchpad cards to highlight Tasks adoption state.
2. **Onboarding & Guides *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Build guided onboarding (checklist, quickstart links, CTA to docs).
   - [ ] Integrate contextual help + links to Tasks runbooks and billing usage.
   - [ ] Capture activation metrics for analytics dashboard.
3. **Billing & Usage Alignment *(Status: 📝 Draft – Nov 2025)***
   - [ ] Ensure billing overview/usage surfaces show Tasks SKUs & usage summaries.
   - [ ] Coordinate feature warnings + upgrade prompts based on Tasks usage thresholds.
   - [ ] Refresh shared `@ma/ui` components with Tasks variants if required.

## Dependencies
- Updated contracts/identity endpoints for Tasks usage + permissions.
- Feature flag scaffolding (`PORTAL_TASKS_ENABLED`) and entitlement data.
- Shared telemetry dashboards from worker/identity.

## Open Questions
- Do we need additional in-app messaging beyond onboarding (e.g., banners, tours)?
- Which metrics gate GA (activation %, queue health, billing conversion)?

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Playwright coverage for Tasks navigation + onboarding states.
- [ ] Analytics events verified end-to-end (portal ➜ identity ingestion).
- [ ] Accessibility review for new Tasks surfaces.
