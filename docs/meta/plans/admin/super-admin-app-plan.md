# Super Admin App Implementation Plan

## Objectives
- Launch a dedicated Super Admin Next.js app under `apps/admin` to manage users across all products.
- Support Super Admins, Support Leads (read-only), and Auditors (audit log visibility) with clear RBAC boundaries.
- Deliver end-to-end tooling for user CRUD, role and permission management, impersonation, bulk actions, and auditing.

## Current Status
- Phase 1 (Discovery & Design) — Completed, plan documented and approved.
- Phase 2 (Backend Enablement) — Completed; identity client proxies, RBAC enforcement, and privileged mutation guards are in place.
- Phase 3 (Frontend Scaffold) — Completed; Next.js app scaffolded with navigation, placeholders, and test coverage.
- Phase 4 (Auth & Access Control) — Completed; session-aware routing, role-scoped navigation, and read-only support workflows shipped.
- Phase 5 (Core User Management) — Completed; global directory now includes status filtering, enriched detail views, and guarded mutation flows for organizations, tenants, entitlements, and user lifecycle updates.
- Phase 6 (Advanced Tooling) — Completed; impersonation flows, bulk job orchestration, and an exportable audit explorer are live behind role-based guardrails.
- Phase 7 (Hardening & Observability) — Completed; app-level error boundaries, telemetry hooks, and feature flag controls are wired into the settings experience.
- Phase 8 (QA & Rollout) — Completed; end-to-end test suites passed and rollout documentation refreshed for Super Admin enablement.

## Architecture & Integration
- Create a standalone app mirroring `apps/portal` and `apps/tasks` with shared tooling (Turborepo, pnpm, lint/test pipelines).
- Reuse `packages/ui`, `packages/core`, and `packages/identity-client`; introduce new shared modules only if gaps emerge.
- Extend existing identity/user services to expose unified APIs for cross-app user data, bulk operations, and audit retrieval.
- Normalize data access through a service or gateway layer with caching, pagination, and optimistic concurrency controls.
- Instrument feature flags to stage rollout and protect existing apps from breaking changes.

## Security & Compliance
- Enforce SSO + MFA for Super Admins, with device/IP allowlisting and session timeout for privileged actions.
- Capture structured audit logs (actor, action, target, timestamp, source IP) for every mutation and impersonation event.
- Provide guardrails: confirmation modals for destructive/bulk actions, soft delete with retention policies, time-bound impersonation.
- Align data handling with GDPR/PII requirements, including export, retention, and consent records.

## User Experience
- Landing dashboard with key metrics (active users per app, recent suspensions, queued invites).
- User directory offering server-side filters (app, status, role, last activity) and quick actions (activate/suspend).
- User detail view with profile, linked applications, login history, role/permission editor, and embedded audit trail.
- Bulk operations wizard (activate, suspend, export) with background job tracking, notifications, and retry paths.
- Audit log explorer featuring advanced filters, diffing for permission changes, and secure export.

## Implementation Phases

4. **Auth & Access Control** — Integrate authentication client, gate routes by role, enforce MFA flows, add smoke E2E tests.
5. **Core User Management** — Build user list/search/detail views, CRUD flows, and permission editor with robust data fetching.
6. **Advanced Tooling** — Implement impersonation UX, bulk operations UI, background job status, and audit log explorer.
7. **Hardening & Observability** — Add telemetry, accessibility improvements, error states, feature flag toggles, documentation.
8. **QA & Rollout** — Run end-to-end and security tests, stage rollout, update runbooks, and train Super Admin stakeholders.

### Phase 1: Discovery & Design Plan
- **Goals** clarify personas, security/compliance constraints, and end-to-end requirements; deliver aligned specifications and UX direction.
- **Stakeholders** Product, Engineering leads, Security/Compliance, Support Operations, and Data/Analytics for auditing/export needs.
- **Workstreams**
  - Requirements intake: interviews, pain-point inventory, success metrics, guardrails.
  - Systems and API assessment: audit current identity services, data flows, gaps, and draft API contracts.
  - Security/compliance review: confirm MFA/SSO, IP/device policies, impersonation guardrails, retention/export obligations.
  - UX research and design: persona journeys, wireframes for core flows (dashboard, list, detail, bulk, audit), accessibility expectations.
  - Delivery planning: convert findings into epics/user stories with acceptance criteria, estimates, risks, and milestone timeline.
- **Artifacts** requirements brief, persona profiles, API contract drafts, security checklist, annotated wireframes, updated roadmap/backlog tickets.
- **Cadence** Week 1 stakeholder interviews & system audit; Week 2 consolidate requirements, draft designs, security workshop; Week 3 iterate, review APIs, finalize discovery packet.
- **Risks & mitigations** conflicting requirements (run alignment sessions, sign-off doc), identity capability gaps (early spike, flag dependencies), compliance ambiguity (engage legal early, document decisions).
- **Phase outcome** (target deliverables)
  - Requirements brief summarizing personas, success metrics, constraints, open questions.
  - Draft API/service contract outlining endpoints, payloads, and data sources for cross-app user management.
  - Initial wireframe set covering dashboard, user list, user detail, bulk actions, audit viewer.
  - Security/compliance checklist capturing MFA, RBAC, impersonation, retention, export obligations.
  - Prioritized backlog (epics/stories) and implementation timeline ready to kick off Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Backend Enablement Plan
- **Goals** build/extend backend capabilities for unified user management, robust RBAC, impersonation, bulk actions, and audit logging with full test coverage.
- **Workstreams**
  - Domain modeling & contracts: finalize aggregated user schema, define endpoints (list/search, detail, mutations, bulk, impersonation, audit), align with `packages/identity-client` and shared contracts.
  - Service enhancements: extend identity service for cross-app queries, soft-delete, permission updates; add role/permission APIs with validation and optimistic locking; implement impersonation tokens with expiry.
  - Bulk operations infrastructure: design background job pipeline (queue, worker responsibilities), expose job tracking/status APIs, ensure idempotency and retries.
  - Audit & observability: define audit event schema/storage, emit events for privileged actions, integrate metrics/logging/tracing and alerts.
  - Security & compliance: enforce MFA/SSO and RBAC on new endpoints, add rate limiting/IP checks, document export/retention guardrails.
- **Deliverables** architecture notes, API specifications (OpenAPI/GraphQL) and updated client typings, necessary migrations with rollback plan, background job configuration, automated unit/integration/load tests, observability dashboards/alerts, security review checklist.
- **Milestones**
  1. Schema and API contracts approved; migrations ready.
  2. Core user and role endpoints implemented with tests.
  3. Impersonation and bulk job pipelines operational in staging.
  4. Audit logging and observability instrumentation complete.
  5. Backend sign-off with demo and documentation for frontend integration.
- **Risks & mitigations** data inconsistency (reconciliation jobs, data ownership matrix), performance of global search (indexing, caching, load tests), security regressions (threat review, feature flags, regression tests), background job complexity (start with narrow scope, robust retry/alerting).

### Phase 3: Frontend Scaffold Plan
- **Goals** establish the `apps/admin` Next.js application with shared tooling, consistent theming, and a maintainable foundation for future features.
- **Workstreams**
  - Project bootstrap: create Next.js app using repo standards (TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind/PostCSS), configure base layout, navigation shell, and global providers.
  - Shared library integration: wire up `packages/ui`, `packages/core`, and future API client modules; set up path aliases and lint/test configs.
  - Routing & architecture: define app directory structure, route groups (dashboard, users, logs, settings), and placeholder pages with loading/error boundaries.
  - State & data layer prep: configure data fetching library (React Query/SWR), error handling patterns, and toast/notification infrastructure.
  - Tooling & CI: update Turbo pipelines, pnpm workspace configs, and CI matrices to include admin app builds, lint, and tests.
- **Deliverables** scaffolding PR, architecture README for the app, Storybook or component playground configuration (if adopted), CI updates, initial smoke tests.
- **Milestones**
  1. App skeleton committed with shared tooling configured.
  2. Navigation layout and placeholder routes available in dev.
  3. CI pipelines green for build/lint/test.
- **Risks & mitigations** configuration drift from existing apps (reuse portal/tasks templates and shared configs), missing shared components (document gaps, create follow-up tickets), build time regression (monitor Turbo cache stats).

### Phase 4: Auth & Access Control Plan
- **Goals** implement secure authentication, RBAC, and session management tailored to super-admin requirements.
- **Workstreams**
  - Auth integration: connect to identity provider via `packages/identity-client`, configure login/SSO flow, and set up secure cookie/session storage.
  - RBAC enforcement: apply route guards, middleware, and component-level checks for Super Admin, Support Lead, and Auditor roles.
  - MFA & re-auth: implement MFA prompts on login and re-authentication gates for privileged actions (impersonation, bulk changes).
  - Session security: handle token refresh, inactivity timeouts, device/IP checks if required, and provide session management UI (active sessions, sign-out).
  - Auth testing: craft unit/integration tests for guards, add Playwright scenarios for access control, simulate unauthorized access.
- **Deliverables** authenticated layout with protected routes, middleware/guards, MFA flows, security documentation, automated tests.
- **Milestones**
  1. Login flow operational in staging with Super Admin role access.
  2. Route-level RBAC checks enforced and tested.
  3. MFA/re-auth flows validated with automated and manual tests.
- **Risks & mitigations** auth provider limitations (coordinate with backend team early), RBAC misconfigurations (create matrix of routes vs. roles and test), user friction from MFA (offer backup codes, communicate policies).

### Phase 5: Core User Management Plan
- **Goals** deliver primary user administration capabilities aligned with backend APIs.
- **Workstreams**
  - Data layer implementation: build hooks/services for list/search/detail endpoints with caching, pagination, and optimistic updates.
  - User directory UI: implement table/grid with filters, sorting, bulk selection, and inline status indicators.
  - User detail & edit flows: create detail panels with profile info, activity logs, role assignment, and edit modals/forms.
  - CRUD operations: implement invite/create, update, suspend/reactivate, and soft delete flows using shared form patterns and validation.
  - Accessibility & performance: ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA roles for tables/forms, and monitor render performance.
- **Deliverables** functional user list/detail/CRUD screens, reusable filter and table components, form validation schemas, integration tests for main flows.
- **Milestones**
  1. Read-only list/detail views consuming live APIs.
  2. Edit/Create flows operational with optimistic updates and validation.
  3. Bulk selection groundwork ready for Phase 6 enhancements.
- **Risks & mitigations** data inconsistency (surface warnings from backend validation), complex form handling (reuse shared form libs), performance of large lists (virtualization, server-side pagination).

### Phase 6: Advanced Tooling Plan
- **Goals** implement high-value admin tools: impersonation, bulk actions, audit exploration, and notifications.
- **Workstreams**
  - Impersonation UX: design initiation modal, confirm scopes, display active impersonation banner with stop controls, enforce timeouts.
  - Bulk operations UI: build wizard for selecting action (activate, suspend, export), review summary, monitor progress with status polling.
  - Audit log explorer: implement searchable/filterable log view with detail drawer showing action metadata and diffs.
  - Notifications & webhooks: integrate toast/system notifications for job completion, tie into email/Slack if required.
  - Error handling & rollback: display partial failure states, provide retry/download links, bubble audit references.
- **Deliverables** impersonation flow, bulk operations screens, audit log viewer, background job status components, end-to-end tests covering impersonation and bulk pipelines.
- **Milestones**
  1. Impersonation end-to-end demo (UI + backend) in staging.
  2. Bulk operations wizard executing activate/suspend jobs successfully.
  3. Audit log explorer surfacing live events with filters.
- **Risks & mitigations** security exposure (double-check guardrails, logging), long-running jobs (stream progress, add cancel safely), UI complexity (conduct UX review, user testing with stakeholders).

### Phase 7: Hardening & Observability Plan
- **Goals** refine resilience, accessibility, performance, and operational insights ahead of launch.
- **Workstreams**
  - Error resilience: add fallback UIs, retry/backoff strategies, offline indicators, comprehensive error boundaries.
  - Performance tuning: audit bundle size, apply code splitting, optimize queries, enable caching strategies, benchmark key flows.
  - Accessibility review: conduct audit (axe, manual testing), address WCAG issues, ensure localization readiness if needed.
  - Observability integration: add tracing spans, structured logs, metrics dashboards, alert thresholds for critical endpoints.
  - Documentation & runbooks: produce operational guides (incident response, background job monitoring, impersonation audits).
- **Deliverables** performance report, accessibility checklist, observability dashboard configs, updated documentation/runbooks, resilience test suites.
- **Milestones**
  1. Performance and accessibility audits completed with remediation.
  2. Observability dashboards live and alerting tuned.
  3. Readiness review sign-off for launch criteria.
- **Risks & mitigations** hidden performance regressions (set performance budgets, continuous profiling), insufficient monitoring (pair with SRE/ops for coverage), accessibility regressions (add automated checks to CI).

### Phase 8: QA & Rollout Plan
- **Goals** validate end-to-end behavior, ensure compliance, and release safely with stakeholder readiness.
- **Workstreams**
  - Testing strategy: finalize test matrix (unit, integration, E2E, exploratory), execute regression suites, and capture sign-offs.
  - Security & compliance validation: run security scans, penetration tests, review audit logging against checklist, finalize data retention policies.
  - Staging & UAT: seed representative data, conduct stakeholder UAT sessions, gather feedback, iterate on polish.
  - Release planning: configure feature flags, deployment pipelines, rollout checklist, rollback procedures, communication plan.
  - Training & handoff: create user guides, host training sessions, transfer ownership to support/ops, set support SLAs.
- **Deliverables** test reports, compliance attestation, UAT feedback log, release checklist, training materials, post-launch monitoring plan.
- **Milestones**
  1. Regression and security test suites passed; issues triaged.
  2. Stakeholder UAT sign-off with action items closed.
  3. Production launch executed with post-launch monitoring and retrospective.
- **Risks & mitigations** undiscovered defects (expand test coverage, beta release), compliance blockers (schedule review early, maintain traceability), rollout issues (feature-flagged rollout, clear rollback plan, monitor closely).

## Phase Dependencies & Testing Gates
- **Prerequisites** Phase 2 backend endpoints must be available in staging before Phases 4–6 proceed; impersonation/bulk features require completed audit logging.
- **Testing cadence** each phase culminates in automated test updates (unit/integration for backend, component/E2E for frontend); CI must remain green before advancing.
- **Feature flags** major capabilities (impersonation, bulk jobs, audit explorer) ship behind flags toggled only after QA sign-off.
- **Documentation linkage** runbooks, checklists, and contracts produced in earlier phases are living documents referenced by later phases; maintain updates as implementation evolves.

## Testing & Operations
- Unit tests (Vitest) for UI components and data hooks; contract tests against identity APIs.
- Integration/E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress) covering login, CRUD, impersonation, and bulk workflows.
- Monitoring dashboards and alerts for admin-specific errors, audit log ingestion, and background job health.
- Document runbooks for impersonation usage, bulk job recovery, and onboarding of new super admins.

## Dependencies & Open Questions
- Confirm identity provider capabilities (RBAC, MFA, impersonation) and required upgrades.
- Determine audit log storage strategy and retention periods.
- Validate SSO, device/IP restrictions, and data export compliance needs across regions.
- Decide whether additional shared infrastructure (e.g., background job processor) is needed for bulk actions.
