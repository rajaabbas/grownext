# Billing v0.1.3 Plan – Admin Console

> This plan rolls up under the billing epic (`docs/meta/plans/epics/billing-epic-v0.1.3.md`).

## Goals
- Deliver finance-facing billing surfaces (catalog, subscriptions, invoices, credits, usage).
- Ensure flows respect `ADMIN_BILLING_ENABLED` and audit trails.
- Provide documentation and Playwright coverage for support workflows.

## Scope
1. **Billing Navigation & Permissions *(Status: ✅ Completed — Oct 2025)***
   - Add billing nav section gated by `ADMIN_BILLING_ENABLED` + role guards.
   - Surface billing pages in layout breadcrumbs.
2. **Finance Tooling *(Status: ✅ Completed — Oct 2025)***
   - Catalog editor, subscription inspector, invoice operations, credit issuance, usage explorer.
   - CLI wiring for credit issuance via identity-client helpers.
3. **QA & Docs *(Status: ✅ Completed — Oct 2025)***
   - Playwright scenarios for catalog edits, usage filters, invoice table.
   - Runbook updates linking admin workflows to ops procedures.

## Remaining Work
- [ ] Deferred to v0.1.4 Tasks Launch Readiness: execute shared billing load test and record outcomes (admin relies on same ingestion numbers).

## Dependencies
- Identity billing APIs (`/super-admin/billing/*`).
- Worker billing queues for invoice/payment sync status updates.
- Portal usage emitters to display data in admin usage explorer.

## Rollout Notes
1. Keep `ADMIN_BILLING_ENABLED` disabled until staging sign-off.
2. After enabling, monitor admin audit logs for billing actions.
3. Coordinate release notes with portal/identity (`docs/meta/releases/billing-v0.1.3.md`).

## Testing & Validation
- Next lint + typecheck.
- Playwright admin billing suite.
- Manual spot checks of credit issuance + invoice status actions in staging.
