# Base Apps Hardening – Admin Plan (v0.2.0)

> Status: 📝 Draft (Oct 2025). Ensures the Super Admin console remains stable while identity guardrails tighten on Oct 23.
>
> Manual validation and monitoring tasks are captured in `docs/meta/plans/admin/v0.2.3.md`.

## Goals
- Validate that admin permissions, impersonation workflows, and support tooling operate correctly with the new identity access controls.
- Resolve UI and stability issues uncovered during the identity rollout.
- Prepare documentation and smoke coverage for the upcoming Oct 25 admin-focused hardening sprint.

## Scope
1. **Permission & Impersonation Verification *(Status: 📝 Draft – Oct 2025)***
   - [x] Test role management, user search, and impersonation flows against updated identity endpoints. _(Automated safeguards added; manual smoke still required to confirm UI banners.)_
   - [x] Confirm audit logs capture new impersonation start/stop events emitted by identity.
   - [x] Ensure any SDK or header changes are reflected in admin API clients.
2. **Support Tooling Stability *(Status: 📝 Draft – Oct 2025)***
   - [x] Verify bulk job dashboards handle new throttling or error states gracefully. _(Bulk operations panel now shows retry guidance when APIs return 429.)_
   - [x] Address UI regressions in job progress, export downloads, and banner messaging.
3. **Docs & Preparation *(Status: 📝 Draft – Oct 2025)***
   - [x] Update admin runbook with guidance on the revised smoke automation triggers.
   - [x] Document any temporary mitigations required before the Oct 25 hardening sprint. _(Runbook updated with throttling guidance.)_
   - [x] Sync support/training materials with the refined access control messaging. _(Admin runbook covers guardrail highlights.)_

## Dependencies
- Identity v0.2.0 guardrail deployment and audit export updates.
- Worker queue instrumentation confirming impersonation cleanup and bulk job status feeds.
- Portal updates for shared UI components leveraged by admin nav/actions.

## Testing & Validation
- [x] Playwright smoke covering user search, impersonation, and bulk job monitoring. _(Executed via CI automation.)_

## Documentation
 - [x] Refresh admin runbook sections related to impersonation safeguards and smoke automation.
 - [x] Capture release notes summarizing admin readiness for Oct 23.
