# Base Apps Hardening – Admin Plan (v0.2.0)

> Status: 📝 Draft (Oct 2025). Ensures the Super Admin console remains stable while identity guardrails tighten on Oct 23.

## Goals
- Validate that admin permissions, impersonation workflows, and support tooling operate correctly with the new identity access controls.
- Resolve UI and stability issues uncovered during the identity rollout.
- Prepare documentation and smoke coverage for the upcoming Oct 25 admin-focused hardening sprint.

## Scope
1. **Permission & Impersonation Verification *(Status: 📝 Draft – Oct 2025)***
   - [ ] Test role management, user search, and impersonation flows against updated identity endpoints.
   - [ ] Confirm audit logs capture new impersonation start/stop events emitted by identity.
   - [ ] Ensure any SDK or header changes are reflected in admin API clients.
2. **Support Tooling Stability *(Status: 📝 Draft – Oct 2025)***
   - [ ] Verify bulk job dashboards handle new throttling or error states gracefully.
   - [ ] Address UI regressions in job progress, export downloads, and banner messaging.
   - [ ] Coordinate with worker to confirm queue telemetry still surfaces correctly in admin views.
3. **Docs & Preparation *(Status: 📝 Draft – Oct 2025)***
   - [ ] Update admin runbook with guidance on the revised smoke automation triggers.
   - [ ] Document any temporary mitigations required before the Oct 25 hardening sprint.
   - [ ] Sync support/training materials with the refined access control messaging.

## Dependencies
- Identity v0.2.0 guardrail deployment and audit export updates.
- Worker queue instrumentation confirming impersonation cleanup and bulk job status feeds.
- Portal updates for shared UI components leveraged by admin nav/actions.

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Playwright smoke covering user search, impersonation, and bulk job monitoring.
- [ ] Manual QA pass for high-risk admin workflows affected by identity throttling.
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard spot-check to ensure metrics remain intact post-deploy.

## Documentation
- [ ] Refresh admin runbook sections related to impersonation safeguards and smoke automation.
- [ ] Capture release notes summarizing admin readiness for Oct 23.
