# Operations & Impersonation Epic (v0.1.1)

This epic captured the cross-app work to improve admin operations, impersonation safeguards, and bulk job processing across the platform.

> **Status:** ✅ Delivered (Jan 2024)

## Linked Plans
- Portal v0.1.1 – `docs/meta/plans/portal/v0.1.1.md`
- Admin v0.1.1 – `docs/meta/plans/admin/v0.1.1.md`
- Identity v0.1.1 – `docs/meta/plans/identity/v0.1.1.md`
- Worker v0.1.1 – `docs/meta/plans/worker/v0.1.1.md`
- Tasks v0.1.1 – `docs/meta/plans/tasks/v0.1.1.md`

## Highlights
- Introduced BullMQ-driven bulk job execution with real-time status updates and CSV export support.
- Added impersonation safeguards across admin and portal (persistent banners, stop actions, audit events, cleanup jobs).
- Exposed enriched audit logs and webhook notifications for admin-triggered actions.
- Surfaced job telemetry and notifications in Tasks/Portal to keep tenants informed of background operations.

## Completed Workstreams
- [x] Identity bulk job queues, audit enhancements, impersonation lifecycle APIs.
- [x] Worker processors for bulk jobs, exports, impersonation cleanup, telemetry publishing.
- [x] Admin console command center UI, impersonation banners, contextual runbooks.
- [x] Portal launchpad updates for admin actions & impersonation awareness.
- [x] Tasks product updates for tenant visibility into bulk operations and queue health.
- [x] Documentation/runbooks updated for new operational flows and safeguards.

## Rollout Notes
- Feature flags limited Super Admin tooling to internal users until queues were validated in staging.
- New environment variables (`SUPER_ADMIN_IMPERSONATION_SECRET`) rotated and documented before release.
- Release notes coordinated across apps to highlight the new operational safeguards.
