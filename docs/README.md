# GrowNext Platform Documentation

This directory aggregates architecture references, onboarding guides, and contribution standards for the multi-product platform.

## Structure

- `architecture.md` – identity, portal, and product interactions (now includes the optional SAML federation flow)
- `contributing.md` – repository workflows and code review expectations
- `onboarding.md` – environment setup, Supabase configuration, and local development recipes
- `Agents.md` – automation guardrails and service boundary expectations
- `deployment.md` (coming soon) – operational runbooks and infrastructure manifests
Additional diagrams and request flow tables live alongside these guides.
