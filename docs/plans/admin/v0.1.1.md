# Admin v0.1.1 Plan

## Goals
- Improve operational clarity for privileged actions (impersonation, bulk jobs).
- Surface contextual runbooks and status banners directly within the console.
- Lay groundwork for background execution of bulk operations.

## Scope
1. **Impersonation safeguards**
   - Display a persistent banner when an impersonation session is active (with quick “stop” action).
   - Auto-expire sessions client-side and notify the user before timeout.
   - Log explicit stop events to the audit explorer.
2. **Bulk jobs command center**
   - Replace immediate “SUCCEEDED” status with progress polling tied to worker updates.
   - Add filters (status, action) and detail drawer for error breakdowns.
   - Support CSV download of job results for EXPORT actions.
3. **Contextual guidance**
   - Add runbook links and recent change information to the user detail sidebar.
   - Surface last audit entry summary on the overview landing page.

## Dependencies
- Identity service must expose job progress and impersonation stop endpoints (see `docs/plans/identity/v0.1.1.md`).
- Worker must publish bulk job status updates (see `docs/plans/worker/v0.1.1.md`).

## Testing
- Update Playwright smoke tests (login → impersonation → stop) and bulk job flow.
- Ensure Vitest coverage for new banners/components and polling hooks.

## Release Notes
- Bump `apps/admin/package.json` version to **0.1.1** once all above tasks ship.
- Document new safeguards in `docs/operations/runbooks/identity.md`.
