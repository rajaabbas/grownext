# Release Plan Conventions

This directory captures the forward-looking plan for each application in the monorepo.  
Every app maintains a folder containing Markdown files named after the *next* semantic version that will ship.  
Each plan should be updated before any version bump lands in `package.json`.

## Workflow

1. **Draft** the upcoming release plan in `docs/plans/<app>/vX.Y.Z.md`.  
2. **Implement** the scoped work (code, migrations, docs, tests).  
3. **Bump** the package version to match the plan once the tasks are complete.  
4. **Archive** or keep the file updated for historical reference; create the next plan before further work begins.

Plans are intentionally conciseâ€”focus on goals, notable changes, dependencies, testing, and rollout notes.  
The AI assistants use these documents to understand context and ensure version numbers stay aligned with agreed scope.
